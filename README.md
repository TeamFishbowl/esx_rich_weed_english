######FISHBOWL EDIT#######


Translated to english.

Also changed the harvested item to "weed". Reason for this is because i have removed the harvesting weed section from esx_illegal_drugs and replaced it with this, but kept the processing weed and selling weed from esx_illegal_drugs.

I take no credit what so ever for the creation of the origenal script. i offer no support for the usage of this script or this edit, however keep in mind the changes you may need to make to your database for this to work for you, keep in mind i am using this in conjunction with esx_illegal_drugs
